< One day, a strange old wizard comes to your village and tells you that
< there is an evil dragon lurking in the hills. This wizard's story explains
< why the village's goats and cows have been going missing lately.
< 
< The wizard tells you: "It is up to you, hero, to stop this dragon. Nobody
< else in this village is foolish...errrr I mean brave enough to stop this
< dragon." 
< 
< The wizard offers you a choice of one of three magic items to help you on
< your quest. 
< 
< The first is a magic whistle that lets you make any bird call that you
< want. The second is a pair of magic shoes that let you jump 10 feet in the
< air. The third is a magic toaster, which can take any item that you can fit
< into it, and turn it into perfectly cooked toast (optionally with butter
< and/or jam). 
< 
< "Choose wisely, for your quest and your village depend on you."
< 
< What would you like to do?
< 
<  1. Choose the magic whistle.
<  2. Choose the magic shoes.
<  3. Choose the magic toaster.
< As you take the magic whistle from the wizard's hand, he disappears in a
< puff of smoke. You decide that you should give the whistle a try before you
< set off to deal with the dragon (after all, if you learned nothing else in
< school, it was that testing is VERY important). 
< 
< You think of a raven and blow on the whistle "CAW CAW CAW CAW". Then you
< think of a chicken and blow "COCKADOODLEDOOOO". It seems like the whistle
< works great, though you wonder how many different birds you can think of
< and how they would help you deal with the dragon. 
< 
< Putting that question in the back of your mind, you contemplate whether or
< not you should get some help before you set out. On the one hand, if you go
< alone, you might be able to better sneak into the dragon's lair. On the
< other hand, help might be useful.
< 
< Fortunately for you, the two wisest people you know, Denevieve and Grew,
< live in the next village over. Thinking about it for several minutes, you
< decide whom to go to for help.
< 
< What would you like to do?
< 
<  1. Go to Denevieve for help.
<  2. Go to Grew for help.
<  3. Go alone.
< After thinking about it for a bit, you decide that Grew is the best
< choice. You go to visit him, and explain your plan: Grew will make some
< cinnamon almond cupcakes with dark chocolate ganache, and you will seranade
< the dragon with your bird calls. Together, you will put the dragon in such
< a good mood that you can befriend him and convince him to leave your
< villages alone. 
< 
< Sadly, while the dragon does find the cupcakes delicious, he wants
< something else to go with them. 
< 
< You have been eaten by a dragon.
< 
< Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
